Go Beyond Basic Finetuning. Tailor Open-Source LLMs to Your Exact Needs with Automated, Fact-Checked Datasets - All Within Your Browser.

About LLM-EasyTune
LLM-EasyTune is an open-source web service revolutionizing how you customize Large Language Models (LLMs). We empower you to move beyond generic models and create bespoke, highly specialized LLMs perfectly aligned with your unique tasks and domains. Forget tedious manual dataset creation and complex finetuning setups. LLM-EasyTune provides an intuitive website experience combined with intelligent AI agents that automatically collect and verify training data from the web, making deep LLM customization accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.

Imagine crafting an LLM finely tuned for your niche industry, specific writing style, or unique problem. LLM-EasyTune makes this a reality.

Key Features (Website Experience):

Deep Customization Focus: Design LLMs for highly specific tasks and domains. Go beyond general-purpose finetuning and create truly specialized models.

AI-Powered Automated Dataset Collection: Leverage intelligent AI agents to automatically surf the web and gather relevant training data based on your customization goals. Define your data needs, and let our agents do the heavy lifting.

Intelligent Fact-Checking & Data Verification: Our AI agents don't just collect data – they actively verify information and filter out inaccuracies, ensuring your LLM is trained on high-quality, reliable datasets. Say goodbye to noisy or biased data.

Curated & Cleaned Datasets: The automated data collection process includes dataset curation and cleaning steps, providing you with ready-to-use, optimized training data.

Intuitive Web Interface for Customization Control: Fine-tune every aspect of your LLM's training through our user-friendly website. Specify customization goals, guide data collection, and adjust finetuning parameters – all without writing a single line of code.

Broad Model Support (Customizable): Customize popular open-source models including:

Llama 2 & Llama 3 (and potentially future Llama versions)

DeepSeek (various models)

Qwen (including Qwen-VL, if applicable)

Google Gemma
